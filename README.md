# twiz
Your Twitter Account Data Analysis &amp; Visualization Tool &lt;3

## motivation

Being a data hunter ( yeah, you read it correct ), I love to collect available data & analyze it for finding hidden patterns in it.

That's why I downloaded my Twitter account data & started analyzing it. This tool can be used for analyzing your twitter account data without sending any of it to remote machines.

I'm adding some features here, if you feel some improvements can be done there, please feel free to contact me or you can always raise a PR.

## usage

**twiz** can be downloaded from PyPI. Make sure you've python _( >=3.7 )_ installed.

```bash
python3 -m pip install twiz
```

If you've added default _pip_ installation path to system **PATH** variable, then it can be invoked as below.
